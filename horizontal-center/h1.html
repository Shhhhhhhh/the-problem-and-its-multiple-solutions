	<!--You can center a block-level element by giving it margin-left and margin-right of auto (and it has a set width, otherwise it would be full width and wouldn't need centering). That's often done with shorthand like this: -->
    <div class="horizontal-center"></div>
    <!-- This will work no matter what the width of the block level element you're centering, or the parent.

Note that you can't float an element to the center.
